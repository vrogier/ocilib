/**
 * @defgroup OcilibCppApiOverview Overview
 * @{
 *
 * @par Introduction
 * OCILIB++ is a C++ API for Oracle built on top of the C OCILIB API:
 *  - Full C API ported to C++
 *  - Implemented as a set of header files, no library compilation needed
 *  - Based on C++ and STL paradigms (Strong typing, templates, containers, RAII, exception handling, operators, stack objects)
 *  - Based on design patterns (RAII, delegation, reference counting, smart pointers, proxies, singleton)
 *  - No user dynamic object allocation required
 *  - The only dependencies are : STL and OCILIB C API
 *
 * @par C++ language requirements
 * - The OCILIB C++ API requires only C++03 features.
 * - It does not required C++11/14/17 but uses some CXX features when target compiler support them 
 *
 * @par Reference counting model
 * - API usage is very simple, based on stack objects wrapping OCILIB handles using reference counting.
 * - OCILIB handles are automatically allocated internally by C++ objects constructors or methods.
 * - They are also automatically freed when the last C++ object referencing it goes out of scope.
 * - Dynamic memory allocation is not required at all.
 * - OCILIB++ allows simple and safe usage of Oracle client without the worries of memory leakages.
 * - Using stack objects also makes error handling easier and program logic more robust
 *
 * @par C++ API classes usage
 * Most C++ API classes wrap C API handles.
 * When instances are created using the default constructors, they hold no C handles and have
 * their method IsNull() returning true.
 * Any use of other methods and functions on such object methods will throw an C++ exception.
 * Thus, in order to have a valid object :
 * - use a parametrized constructor
 * - use the default constructor and then later assign a value to the instance using assignment operator.
 * In the later case, the value can be provided by a function return value or using the object class constructor
 *
 * @par Exception model
 * - Any failure occurring within an OCILIB C API call will throw a ocilib::Exception
 * - For conformance reasons, this class derives from std::Exception
 *
 * @warning
 *  - OCILIB++ wraps the whole OCILIB C API.
 *  - Each C OCILIB object handle has its C++ class counter part.
 *  - The whole OCILIB C Documentation (concepts, use cases, features) is still valid for OCILIB++
