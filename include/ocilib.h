/* IMPORTANT NOTICE
 *
 * This file contains explanations about Oracle and OCI technologies. 
 * OCILIB is a wrapper around OCI and thus exposes OCI features. 
 * The OCILIB documentation intends to explain Oracle / OCI concepts
 * and is naturally based on the official Oracle OCI documentation. 
 * 
 * Some parts of OCILIB documentation may include some information 
 * taken and adapted from the following Oracle documentations :
 *  - Oracle Call Interface Programmer's Guide
 *  - Oracle Streams - Advanced Queuing User's Guide
