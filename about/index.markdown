OCILIB has been designed, developed and maintained by me, [{{site.ocilib_author}}]({{site.meurl}}).

## Quick OCILIB History

Years ago, I had developed a C++ wrapper around OCI that was compatible Oracle 7 (old OCI API) and Oracle 8 (new OCI API).
<br/>
But this wrapper, although used in applications in production was not really well designed, poorly commented and did not have the quality for being released as an open source library. 
<br/>
The internal support for both OCI7 and OCI8 api made the internal code complex and too heavy to maintain.
<br/>
That's why I've started another wrapper in C (for compatibility and portability). 
<br/>
Early development of OCILIB (based on my previous C++ wrapper) started at summer 2007.
<br/>
OCILIB first public release (v1.0.0) was achieved in October 2007.
<br/>
Few years later and thousand of hours spent on it, OCILIB had became the reference open source C library for dealing with Oracle database.
