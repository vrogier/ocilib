    * Extended OCI_ImmediateXXX() API

    * Extended OCI_XXXFmt() API

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - Added OCI_Ping()
      - Added Exception type OCI_ERR_CREATE_OCI_ENVIRONMENT if internal Oracle OCI environment handle cannot be allocated
      - Updated documentation (page <modules> <Installing OCILIB>)
      - Modified GNU configure script : the Oracle OCI library folder search sequence is now : lib32, lib, lib64

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed OCI_CollAssign() that was assigning destination collection to source collection
      - Fixed missing const qualifier in some Direct Path functions prototypes	
      - Fixed OCI_ElemSetXXX() for numeric types that was returning FALSE for local collection
      - Fixed PL/SQL tables binds for non scalar types (wrong values handled since v3.2.0)
      - Fixed possible infinite recursivity when calling some OCI_ErrorGetXXX() calls within an error handler at OCILIB initialization
      - Fixed Error message if Oracle shared lib was not found : libray name was not correct on unicode builds
      - Fixed OCI_GetString() : in mixed charset builds, the returned string was truncated for numeric columns 
      - Fixed internal function OCI_MoveString() for inplace string buffers packing/expansion
      - Fixed in/out or out string binds :
        * bind indicator is now not reset to "not null" after an execute call if the statement is PL/SQL code
        * wide string binds on Unixes platforms (Mixed and Unicode builds) : 
          - the trailing null character was missing if the binded string had been shortened by some PL/SQL code or user
          - internal initialization of bind array of data lens : the len was including null terminator character and could lead to some memory corruptions
      - Fixed some demo example codes 
      - Fixed computation of internal OCI_Object sub objects offsets in their parents indicator array (could have caused segfaults and/or bad indicator values)
      - Fixed problems with OCI_Elem internal null indicators :
          - In some cases, a segfault caused by a null pointer could happened
          - For OCI_Object handles holded by an OCI_Elem handle, the object internal indicator strucure was not properly set/retreived
