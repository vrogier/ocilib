2010-07-XX Version 3.7.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Added support for Oracle Streams AQ (advanded Queues)

    * Added support for Session Pools

      - Added support for Oracle Session pools :

        - This features has beed introduced in Oracle 9.2
        - For Oracle clients < 9.2, sessions are handled as regular connection pools

      - Renamed type OCI_ConnPool to OCI_Pool
      - Renamed all OCI_ConnPooXXX() calls to OCI_PoolXXX()
      - Added macros that maps old OCI_ConnPoolXXX() prototypes to OCI_PoolXXX() functions
      - Added new parameter 'type' to OCI_PoolCreate(). Possible values are

        - OCI_POOL_CONNECTION : creates a connection pool
        - OCI_POOL_SESSION    : creates a session pool

      - Added support for session pool tagging :

        - Added OCI_GetSessionTag()
        - Added OCI_SetSessionTag()

      - Added new parameter 'tag' to OCI_PoolGetConnection() 

      - Updated documentation :

        - Renamed page <module>, section <Connection pooling> to <Oracle pooling>
        - Added Information abour session pooling

    * Extended fetch interface

      - Added OCI_GetStruct()
      - Added OCI_SetStructNumericType()
      - Added demo file fetch_struct.c

    * Improved Execute/Fetch performance with prepared statement

      - Improved by x15 fetch performance when executing and fetching prepared statements that return resultsets
      
          - Prior to v3.7.0 :

              - Before a prepared statement was re-executed, any previous resultset was freed
              - Then, once the statement was re-executed, the resultset was recreated by OCI_GetResultset()

          - From v3.7.0 :

              - the resulset is create only once and is just reinitialized before re-execution
              - Avoiding these unecessary memory allocations/deallocations improves drastically the performances

    * Extended Array interface

      - Added OCI_SetBindAllocation()
      - Added OCI_GetBindAllocation()
      - Improved drastically performance for handle based array internally created or externally created with OCI_xxxxArrayCreate()
      - Added demo file array_internal.c

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - Modified connection internal handles allocation/deallocation: 

         - Server handle is now allocated/deallocated when physical connection to server is created/freed
         - Session and context handles are now allocated/deallocated at logon/logoff time
         - Before theses handles were all allocated/deallocated when physical connection to server was created/freed
         - The old way could cause problems with old Oracle versions
      
       - Existing programs must be recompiled (in order to use this new version of ocilib) with no co change (as compatibilty macros are provided)

    * Miscellaneous fixes
    
      - Fixed OCI_Object binding : 
	
         - internal objects indicator structures were not binded properly
         - even if the internal objects indicators were updated correctly, it was not seen by the server
         - Only the object itself nullity flag was sent to server

      - Fixed OCI_Object members internal offset computation for 64bits builds
      - Fixed OCI_DirPathSave() that couln't execute on a loaded stream
      - Fixed Connection Pooling emulation for Oracle 8i
      - Fixed warnings when compiling OCILIB with OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE and Oracle 8i
      - Fixed Batch error handling :
        
         - some errors could not have be caught
         - Added checks in OCI_GetBatchErrorCount()
