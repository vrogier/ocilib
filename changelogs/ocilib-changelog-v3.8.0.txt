    * Added support for SQL parsing only
 
      - Added OCI_Parse()
      - Added OCI_ParseFmt()

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - All OCILIB source files have been reformatted using uncrustify (best source code formatter ever tried !!)
      - Source code max line length have been modified (80 -> 100 characters)

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed memory leak : if an OCI_Bindxxx() returned FALSE (eg. non present binds in the sql statment), the newly internal allocated bind object was not freed
      - Fixed possible segfault in OCI_Cleanup() if OCI_SubscriptionRegister() had been previouly called call unsuccessfully
      - Fixed internal array allocation when using OCI_ArraySetSize() called many times on the same prepared SQL statement
      - Fixed OCI_ElemGetTimeStamp() and OCI_ElemGetInterval() when collections are retreived from the server 
      - Fixed possible segfault in OCI_TimestampFromCTime() and OCI_TimestampFromCTime() if the libc function localtime() returns a NULL tm structure pointer
      - Fixed OCI_GetSessionTag() linkage : the function was internally named OCI_GetSessionData() instead of OCI_GetSessionTag() in connection.c
      - Fixed binding of date arrays : the introduction of OCI_XXXArrayCreate() in v3.6.0 has introduced a bug in dates array binding that would cause to pass NULL data for some elements of the array
      - Fixed some API naming inconstancy (lower/upper case)

        - OCI_ElemGetTimeStamp()      renamed to OCI_ElemGetTimestamp()
        - OCI_ObjectGetTimeStamp()    renamed to OCI_ObjectGetTimestamp()
        - OCI_TimestampSysTimeStamp() renamed to OCI_TimestampSysTimestamp()
        - Macros have been added for backward compatibility

        - Existing programs must be recompiled (in order to use this new version of ocilib) with no code change (as compatibility macros are provided)
