      - Added Exception type OCI_ERR_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND
      - Added Exception type OCI_ERR_DIRPATH_STATE
      - updated demo application with a direct path loading example
      - Added source code of a standalone application in demo directory
      
    * Modified Database objects describe API

      - OCI_Schema handle has been renamed to OCI_TypeInfo
      - All OCI_SchemaXXX() functions have been renamed to OCI_TypeInfoXXX()
      - Constants OCI_SCHEMA_XXX have been renamed to OCI_TIF_XXX
      - Macro have been added to mapp old types, defines and names to new ones for backward compatibility

    * Extended binding possibilities

      - Added OCI_BindArrayGetSize()
      - Added OCI_AllowRebinding()
      - Different host variables can be binded to the same statement bind placeholder
      - It's possible the update a bind array real number of element before execution
      - Added exception type OCI_ERR_BIND_ARRAY_SIZE
      - Fixed OCI_SetNullXXX() : the upper bound of an array bind was not checked

    * Extended Object API

      - Added OCI_ObjectGetStruct()
      - Now it's possible to retrieve the underlying C (OTT style) structure of an OCI_Object handle

    * Fixed OCI_Element API

      - Modified OCI_ElemCreate() that takes now an OCI_TypeInfo handle instead of an OCI_Connection handle
      - Fixed OCI_ElemFree() that could not free underlying sub objects OCI handles
      - Fixed segfaults when using local instance of OCI_Elem objects created wit OCI_ElemCreate()

    * Extended UROWID support

      - Large UROWID hexadecimal strings where truncated to OCI_ROWID_SIZE (default 23) characters
      - Now OCILIB handles correctly UROWID columns (size up to 4000 chars)
         
    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed OCI_TimestampToCTime() : members tm_year and tm_mon of the tm structure passed to the function were not properly set
      - Fixed memory leak : when re-executing a prepared statement that hold a SQL 'select', internal OCI column descriptor for each column of the resultset was not freed
      - Fixed implicit conversion of numeric data to string when using OCI_GetString() in mixed and Unicode builds : Entire values had a trailing dot.
      - Fixed OCI_LongRead() : internal offset variable was not reset across OCI_FetchNext() calls causing NULL reads after some fetch sequences
      - Fixed memory leak in internal function OCI_ObjectInit()
      - Fixed configure script for GNU package to detect OCI header location of some older versions ($ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/demo)
      - Fixed internal OCI_StringCopy2to4bytes() when converting internal Oracle UTF16 strings with odd lengths to Unix UTF32 strings
      - Renamed OCI_ColumnGetFractionnalPrecision() to OCI_ColumnGetFractionalPrecision() - added macro for backward compatibility
      
    * Updated windows package

      - Added 2 code::blocks projects
         - ocilib_static_lib_mingw.cbp : to build OCILIB as a 32 bits static library (ansi, mixed and unicode builds) in ocilib/proj/mingw
         - ocilib_demo_codeblocks.cbp  : to build OCILIB 32 bits demo application (ansi, mixed and Unicode builds) in ocilib/proj/test
      - Precompiled OCILIB 32 bits static libraries are now provided within the package :
         - built with Code::Block 8.03 (minGW / gcc-core-3.4.5)
         - available static libs in ocilib/lib32 : libociliba.a (ansi), libocilibm.a (mixed), libocilibw.a (unicode)
      - OCILIB prebuilt Dlls are still compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio
      
    * Miscellaneous internal changes

      - The object cache is now freed when a connection is terminated
      - Internal source file schema.c has been renamed to typeinfo.c
      - Internal source file dirpath.c has been added
      - Fixed some internal calls to please GDCC and its aliasing warnings with -Wall options
      
    * Documentation updates 

      - Added notes in OCI_ConnectionCreate() documentation for using External credentials
      - Added notes in OCI_BindArraySetSize() documentation for modifying input array number of elements between statement executions
      - All OCILIB headers and sources files (45 files - 43.000 lines) have been checked with spell checker to correct typos (my English remains not so good !)
