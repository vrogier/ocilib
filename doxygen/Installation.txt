 *
 * @par Compatibilities
 *
 * Actual version of OCILIB has been validated on :
 *  - Platforms: Windows, HP/UX, Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, AIX
 *  - Architectures: 32/64bits
 *  - Compilers: GCC / MinGW, MS Compilers, IBM XLC, CCs, LabView
 *  - Oracle versions: 8i, 9i, 10g, 11g
 *
 * Please, contact the author if you have validated OCILIB on platforms or compilers not listed here.
 *
 * @par Global build options
 *
 * OCILIB supports the following global build options:
 *
 * => Oracle import modes
 *
 *  - OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE for linkage at compile time (default on Unix systems)
 *  - OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME for runtime loading (default with prebuilt OCILIB libraries on MS Windows)
 *
 * => Oracle charset modes
 *
 *  - OCI_CHARSET_ANSI  : ANSI strings or UT8 strings (default)
 *  - OCI_CHARSET_WIDE  : wide strings using ISO C wide character
 *
 * => Calling convention (WINDOWS ONLY)
 *
 *  - OCI_API = __cdecl or blank for C/C++ only ! (default on Unix systems and non MSVC projects)
 *  - OCI_API = __stdcall to link OCILIB shared library on Ms Windows (default for MSVC projects)
 *
 * @note
 *
 * On Windows, OCI_API MUST be set to __stdcall in order to use prebuilt libraries
 * The header file "ocilib.h" automatically sets OCI_API to  __stdcall with MS compilers
 *
 * @par Using OCILIB on UNIX like systems
 *
 * OCILIB uses GNU autotools for compilation and installation on UNIX like platforms
 *
 * Uncompress the archive (ocilib-x.y.z-gnu.tar.gz)
 *  - $ cd ocilib-x.y.z
 *  - $ ./configure
 *  - $ ./make
 *  - $ ./make install (this step might require admin rights)
 *
 * Check the shared library path environment variable (LD_LIBRARY_PATH, LD_PATH, ...):
 *  - it must include $ORACLE_HOME\[lib|lib32|lib64]
 *  - it must include the path where OCILIB has been installed
 *    (by example, typically /usr/local/lib under Linux)
 *
 * In order to get these values loaded at logon time, export these values in
 * your .profile configuration file :
 *  - > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/usr/local/lib
 *
 * <b>GNU Installation options </b>:
 *
 * OCILIB supports some options that are not needed for most common configurations.
 *
 * List of available options:
 *
 *  - --with-oracle-import=(linkage|runtime)
 *  - --with-oracle-charset=(ansi|wide)
 *  - --with-oracle-home=(custom oracle regular client directory)
 *  - --with-oracle-headers-path=(oracle header files directory)
 *  - --with-oracle-lib-path=(oracle shared lib directory)
 *  - --with-oracle-lib-name=(oracle shared lib name)
 *  - --with-custom-loader=(linker flag telling the linker which loader to use
 *      when loading dynamically at runtime Oracle shared libs.
 *      This option must be provide if the platform does not use the default
 *      loader flag '-ldl') and the --with-oracle-import is set to 'runtime'
 *
 * @note
 *
 * --with-oracle-headers-path and --with-oracle-lib-path are meant to be used with
 * Instant client only but can used for regular client of libs and headers are
 * not located in usual folders
 *
 * @note
 *
 * If the Oracle OCI linkage mode is set to 'linkage' (default) and no Oracle lib
 * path is provided, OCILIB configure script tries to located the Oracle library
 * folder following this sequence :
 *  - $ORACLE_HOME/lib32 (32 bits libs)
 *  - $ORACLE_HOME/lib   (32 or 64 bits libs)
 *  - $ORACLE_HOME/lib64 (64 bits libs)
 *
 * @note
 *
 * To compile native 64 bits versions of OCILIB, you might need pass your compiler
 * specifics flags to the configure script (e.g. '-m64' for GCC)
 *
 * To use OCILIB in a project:
 *
 * - include "ocilib.h" in your application
 * - Add the flag -I$USER_LIBS/include to your compiler
 * - Defines OCILIB modes:
 *    - OCI import  mode (-DOCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE | -DOCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME)
 *    - OCI charset mode (-DOCI_CHARSET_ANSI   | -DOCI_CHARSET_WIDE)
 * - Add the flag -L/$ORACLE_HOME/[lib|lib32|lib64] -lclntsh to the linker
 * - Add the flag -L$USER_LIBS/lib -locilib to the linker
 *
 * where :
 * - $USER_LIBS is the folder where OCILIB was installed
 * - $ORACLE_LIB_PATH is Oracle client shared library path
 *
 * Some older version of Oracle 8 have direct path API symbols located in the library libclient8.
 * With these versions, you must include as well the linker flag -lclient8 to use Direct Path API.
 *
 * @par Using OCILIB on Microsoft Windows
 *
 * OCILIB distribution packages provides prebuilt 32bits and 64bits DLLs
 *
 * - Uncompress the archive (ocilib-x.y.z-windows.zip)
 * - Copy ocilib/include/ocilib.h to a folder listed in the compiler headers folders
 * - Copy ocilib/lib[32|64]/ocilib[x].lib to a folder listed in the linker libraries folders
 * - Copy ocilib/lib[32|64]/ocilib[x].dll to a folder included in the PATH
 *   environment variable
 *
 * [x] is the compiled version of OCILIB ('a' -> ANSI, 'w' -> Wide character, e.g. Unicode)
 *
 * To use OCILIB in a project :
 *
 * - include "ocilib.h" in your application
 * - define call convention (OCI_API) to __stdcall
 * - define charset mode (OCI_CHARSET_ANSI | OCI_CHARSET_WIDE)
 *
 * Note for MinGW users:
 * - Precompiled 32bits static libraries libocilib[x].a are provided
 * - To use OCILIB dll's, copy/rename import libraries ocilib[x].lib to libocilib[x].lib
 * - Add the desired version (static/shared + charset) of the library to the linker options
 *
 * Note for recompiling OCILIB:
 * - Microsoft Visual Studio solutions (2013 and 2015) are also provided to compile OCILIB Dlls and demos.
 * - OCILIB library code compiles at highest warning level without any warnings with provided MSVC projects
 * - These projects deactivate the following warnings generated by the inclusion of Windows SDK headers: 4255, 4668, 4996, 4710, 4711, 4738, 4774, 4820
 *
 * @note
 *
 * The OCI import mode (OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE or OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME is only used when compiling OCILIB source code
 *
 * @par Oracle Instant Client Support
 *
 * OCILIB supports Oracle Instant Client.
 *
 * On Microsoft Windows, there is no difference between using a regular Oracle
 * client and an Instant Client with OCILIB
 *
 * On Unix-like systems, the Instant Client is divided in different packages.
 *
 * Public headers and shared libs are not part of the same package.
 *
 * So, you must provide the following options to the configure command:
 *
 * - with-oracle-headers-path: location the public header files
 * - with-oracle-lib-path: location the oracle shared lib
 *
 * If your instant client package containing the shared libs does not have a symbolic link
 * 'libclntsh.[shared lib extension]' to the fully qualified shared lib real name,
 * you must create it:
 *
 * Example on Linux:
 *
 * - $ ln -s $ORALIBPATH/libclntsh.so.10.1 $ORALIBPATH/libclntsh.so
 *
