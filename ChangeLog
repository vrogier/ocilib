2018-02-21 Version 4.5.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Changes (C API)

        - Updated driver information set by OCILIB since v3.1.0 (column CLIENT_DRIVER in V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO)
            * it is now including OCILIB version (e.g. "OCILIB : x.y.z" instead of "OCILIB")
        - Extended OCI_SeTrace() and OCI_GetTrace():
            * Added OCI_TRC_OPERATION: Name of the database operation set by the client application to be monitored (according Oracle docs)
            * This value is stored the database in the column DBOP_NAME of the system view V$SQLMONITOR
            * OCI_GetTrace() returns now NULL instead of an empty string if the given trace is not set or nullified
        - Release Windows binaries are now built using VS 2017 15.5.6 (instead of VS2017 15.3.2)

    * Fixes (C API)
    
		- Driver information (introduced in Oracle 11gR1: was set by OCILIB if
			- Oracle version >= 11gR1 for standalone connections and connections retrieved from connection pools
			- Oracle version >= 11gR2 for connections retrieved from session pools
			- Now it sets it correctly in all cases when Oracle version >= 11gR1 
		- Issue #141: OCIBindRaw() now accepts empty buffers (non null data with size = 0)
        - Issue #142: OCI_GetStruct() was filling numeric fields with garbage values since v4.5.0
        - Issue #143: OCI_SetTrace(): passing NULL values for clearing trace information leads to segfaults
        - Issue #144: OCI_SetTrace(); If called at least once, it was causing small memory leak in OCI_ConnectionFree()
        - Issue #145: Using OCI_BAM_INTERNAL for types using handles was leading to segfault when executing the statement
            * Impacted types:OCI_Object, OCI_Lob, OCI_File, OCI_Timestamp, OCI_Interval, OCI_Ref and OCI_Collection
        
    * Fixes (C++ API)
    
        - Issue #141: ocilib::Statement::Bind<ocilib::Raw, unsigned int>() accepts now empty ocilib::Raw

    * Miscellaneous:

        - OCILIB requires now C99 to be activated for compiling:
            * When using autotools (Unixes): Enforcing C99 compiler flags using AC_PROG_CC_STDC() macro
            * When using Visual Studio: OCILIB cannot be compiled anymore with VS2010 and earlier versions (released binaries use VS 2017)
			* This was motivated for using variadic macros and allow variable declarations not only at beginning of blocks
        - Addressed static code analysis hints and warnings
        - Internal code refactoring and factorization
        - Reduced cyclomatic complexity of some internal functions
            * Some methods (connection logon/logoff, bindings) were far too long and had been decomposed and split in smaller ones
       - Fixed demo an script files

        - Issue #101: Wrong OCI_STRING_FORMAT_TIMESTAMP constant
        - Fix for Oracle bug #9838993 workaround
            * Version 4.2.1 introduced support for an experimental workaround for Oracle bug 9838993 (memory leak when using Unicode and re-preparing/executing same statement multiple times)
            * This support was not always working as column names where sometimes not null terminated
            
    * Enhancements (C API)
              
        - OCI_Object: Supporting now non final object types
            * if an OCI_Object instance real type is a sub type of its column object type, OCILIB is dynamically retrieving its real and right type instead of processing it as its base type
            * Added missing synchronized access when iterating the list of existing OCI_TypeInfo in OCI_TypeInfoGet()
        - Allocation Binding mode updates
            * Added BindGetAllocationMode()

            * Refactored OCI_List implementation
        
 2017-06-07 Version 4.3.3 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Fixes (C API)

        - Issue #81: Fixed OCI_GetInt() on string columns 
            * Wrong implicit string to integer conversion (returning 0 whatever string value) occurred under following conditions: 
                - Column is string based
                - Oracle client < 12gR1
                - Using OCI_GetInt() or OCI_GetUnsignedInt()
        - Issue #86: Fixed wrong error information when statement execution failed involving 64bit integer binds
            * It occurred under following conditions:     
                - Binding 64bit integer host variables with OCI_BDM_OUT flag set (default if OCI_BindSetDirection() has not been called)
                - Statement execution failed on the server for any reasons (server side error, constraint violation, ..) 
            * Real server side error information was not reported by OCI_GetLastError() or error callback
            * Instead an error "OCI-22060: argument [2] is an invalid or uninitialized number" was reported
        - Issue #88: Fixed OCI_GetString() on BLOB columns with blob size > 1024 bytes
            * Filling the resulting string with BLOB data led to a buffer overflow 
        - Issue #89: Fixed Segfault occurring in OCI_Execute()
            * The issue was a wrong offset computation when trying to update user strings after execution.
            * It occurred under following conditions:     
                - OCI_CHARSET_WIDE (Unicode) ocilib build 
                - Unix/Linux (wchar_t implemented as 32bit integers)
                - Binding host string variable with OCI_BDM_OUT flag set (default if OCI_BindSetDirection() has not been called)
           
    * Fixes (C++ API)
 
        - Issue #63: (Re)Added cstddef header in ocilib_core.hpp as on some platforms/compiler versions, it was reported as needed (including <iterator> was not enough)

    * Enhancements (C API)

        - Issue #84: Add support for numeric type in OCI_ColumnGetSubType() with limitations as real numeric type cannot really be identified
        
2017-02-08 Version 4.3.2 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Fixes (C API)
    
        - Issue #69: Fixed OCI_StatementGetConnection() that was returning erroneous values (regression introduced in v4.3.0)
        - Issue #70: Fixed Subscriptions issues when OCILIB charset is OCI_CHARSET_WIDE (Unicode builds)
		    * Bug with table names, objects names and rowids reported from CDN event callbacks:
				- Up to Oracle 10g, theses strings were reported as ANSI strings instead of UTF16 strings, thus OCILIB was doing a translation to UTF16 before calling user callbacks
				- From Oracle 11g, this Oracle bug seems fixed while OCILIB is still trying to perform translation fro; ANSI to UTF16
				- Thus, now OCILIB, in Unicode builds, is performing the translation to UTF16 only if reported strings seems to be ANSI
			* Bug with Oracle call OCISubscriptonUnRegister()
				- OCI_SubscriptionUnregister() encounters an error ora-24015 when calling OCISubscriptonUnRegister() in Unicode build but not in ANSI builds 
				- Error ORA-24915 is now discarded if returned from OCISubscriptonUnRegister() in OCI_SubscriptionUnregister()
		- Issue #71: Fixed regression introduced in v4.3.0 about binding big_uint variables (only unsigned 64bit integers)
			* Pre and post statement execution methods were only handling big_int and not big_uint host variables
			* Root cause was a wrong numeric sub type check (using == instead of operator &) as subtypes are handled using flags not unitary values
		- Issue #72: Fixed OCI_LobErase() return value that was wrong since v4.3.0 (1 on success and 0 on failure) instead of the number of elements erased from the LOB
		- Issue #75: Fixed OCI_ElemIsNull() that was marking the call as failed is the value was not NULL (regression introduced in v4.3.0)
		- Issue #78: Fixed usage of OCI_SetBindAllocation() when switching bind allocation mode that may result in memory leaks
        - Issue #79: Fixed issues in implicit conversion in OCI_GetString()
			* Updated outdated OCI_GetString() documentation
			* Reduce temporary buffer size in  OCI_GetString() conversions
			* Fixed implicit conversions in OCI_GetString() for LONG, BLOB

	* Changes and Enhancements
	
        - Issue #73: Activate support for N' substitution (NCHAR replacement in SQL statement strings) when source code is Unicode (Only for Oracle Client >= 10gR2)
	    - Issue #74: Added support for OCI_Number in format calls	   
			* Added token '%n' for parsing OCI_Number in OCI_xxxFmt() calls
			* Added OCI_ARG_NUMBER for fetching OCI_Number in OCI_Immediate() and OCI_ImmediateFmt() calls

    * Fixes (C API) 
    
        - Issue #60: Fixed bug introduced in v4.3.0 related to binding arrays of big ints
        - Issue #64: Fixed structure size computation for Object members that are Objects
        - Issue #65: Fixed Binding null/non initialized OCI_Number
            * Even if OCI_BindSetNullAtPos() was called, attempting to bind a non initialized or null OCI_Number led to statement execution failure
        - Issue #68: Fixed OCI_Excecute() behavior with PL/SQL "select into" and no data found
            * When executing a PL/SQL block with inner PL/SQL code like "select into :<bind_variable> from table" that does fetch anything, Oracle call OCIStmtExecute() returns OCI_NO_DATA, which is handled by OCILIB as an failure
            * Now OCI_Excecute() considers OCI_NO_DATA as success
            * Updated OCI_GetAffectedRows() documentation for determining if inner PL/SQL "select into" was successful
            
    * Fixes (C++ API) 

        - Issue #63: Added cstddef header in ocilib_core.hpp as on some platforms/compiler versions, it was reported as needed
        - Issue #67: Fixed memory leak when using Number objects
            * Removed attempt to use move semantics 
            * It is currently causing memory leaks  and does not bring that much as C API handles are already handled using smart pointers

    * Changes:
        - Request #66: Increased value of OCI_BIND_MAX
            * Increased value of OCI_BIND_MAX from 1024 to 65535
            * Now Internal Arrays of OCI_Bind can grow and are reallocated by blocks of 128 binds

        - OCI_ObjectGetString(): Fixed usage of internal temporary buffers
        - OCI_FileRead(): Return value was not the correct one
        - OCI_PoolGetConnection() : was returning NULL connections for session pool using external credentials

2016-03-21 Version 4.2.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Licensing
    
        - Re-licensing OCILIB to Apache License Version 2.0 instead of LGPL 2.1: this is merely for overcoming the static linkage issue of the LGPL V2.1
        
    * Fixes

        - C++ API: Fixed memory leak caused by Statement::Bind() with non scalar types when Connection objects are closed before their child Statement objects get out of scope
        - C++ API: Fixed minor compilation warnings
        - C API: Compilation was broken when targeting Oracle 8i
        - C API: PL/SQL statements starting with keyword "CALL" where not identified as PL/SQL commands and thus output bind buffers were not updated accordingly
        - C API: OCI_Execute() ignored custom fetch and prefetch values with Oracle clients >= 9.2
        - C API: OCI_ElemSetString() caused memory retention when dealing repetitively with string attributes
        - C API: OCI_Cleanup() leaked of few bytes
        - C API: OCI_BindLob() caused access violation when binding CLOB/BLOB to PL/SQL OUT parameters using OCI_BDM_OUT bind direction mode   
        - C API: OCI_DirPathSetEntry() may passed Wrong SQL type passed to OCI_NumberFromString() for some numeric columns
        - C API: OCI_GetLastError() wWas not reporting errors/warnings after the following calls: OCI_FetchPrev(), OCI_FetchNext(), OCI_FetchFirst() and OCI_FetchLast()
        - C API: OCI_MemRealloc() may manipulate dandling pointers
        - C API: Fixed some usage of OCI_BIND_CALL() macro
        - C API: OCI_ObjectGettring(): When the attribute type was not a string, the application error handler
          was called with error code OCI_ERR_ATTR_NOT_FOUND and then the method was converting the attribute to a string without problem as expected.
     
    * Changes

        - Added "Environment Variables" section in the C API documentation
        - C++ API: Added silent parameter to Date::Date()
        - C API: Fetch and prefetch values are not reset any more to default values when statement is re-prepared
        - C API: Added support for specific environment variables: Now specific documented environment variables can be set for activating
          experimental or optional behaviors mostly for implementing workaround for Oracle Bugs.
        - C API: Added experimental workaround for unsolved Oracle OCI bug #9838993 using the environment variable "OCILIB_WORKAROUND_UTF16_COLUMN_NAME"

            * C++ API: Added ocilib::Connection::GetMaxCursors()
 
    * Enhancements:

        - C++ API:: Enhanced pre/post statement execution check for binds
        
            * Before execution, bind buffers are only updated from host variables if Bind Direction has the ocilib::BindInfo::In flag
            * After execution, host variables are only updated from bind buffers if Bind Direction has the ocilib::BindInfo::Out flag
            
    * Fixes:
        
        - C API: Fixed OCI_GetLastError() that returned NULL after OCI_Initialize() if OCI shared lib cannot be loaded
        - C API: Fixed OCI_ColumnGetSQLType() that has its break statements within the switch removed by mistake leading to return "?" in all cases

        - C API: Fixed minor internal bugs and issues
        - C++ API: ocilib::HandleHolder<T>::Acquire() => Made sure that a smart handle is not allocated if the input C handle is NULL (even if it shall not happen as the C API must raise an error if it cannot return a valid handle)
        - C++ API: ocilib::HandleHolder<T>::SmartHandle::~SmartHandle() => the C API handle free function is now called only if the handle is not NULL
        - C++ API: Fixed compilation error when using OCI_CHARSET_WIDE
        - C++ API: Fixed ocilib::Raw binding when using OCI_CHARSET_WIDE

2015-05-05 Version 4.1.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * C API

        - Major library code update:
            * All public functions entry and exit points have been rewritten in order to satisfy requirements of the OCI_ENV_CONTEXT environment flag
            * Fixed some functions that were not setting context result properly when using OCI_ENV_CONTEXT flag
            * various internal code updates and minor fixes
            * OCI_EnableWarnings() and OCI_SetErrorHandler() are now return a boolean values
            * Factorized internal OCILIB objects clean up in various places
           
        - Enhanced implicit string conversion for Date, Timestamps and Numeric values
            * Conversion formats can be now set at both library and connection level
                - The library is using its own default format if none are set
                - Program can define formats at library level
                - Program can define formats for a specific connection
            * It is now possible define specific conversion formats for:
                - OCI_Date
                - OCI_Timestamp
                - All Numeric types
                - Binary double
                - Binary float             
            * Added new methods:
                - OCI_SetFormat()
                - OCI_GetFormat()
            * Removed the following methods that are now defined as macros for backward compatibility reasons:
                - OCI_SetDefaultFormatDate()
                - OCI_GetDefaultFormatDate()
                - OCI_SetDefaultFormatNumeric()
                - OCI_GetDefaultFormatNumeric()

        - Fixes      
            * Fixed compilation under oracle 11gR1 caused by wrong oracle version checking in the file pool.c
            * Fixed few warnings raised by Clang C compiler
            * Fixed Binary Float implicit conversion to string when using Oracle 12g
            * Fixed UTF8 strings bytes size computing when passing them to Oracle client
            * Fixed binding double and float when Oracle client >= 10.1 and Oracle Server < 10.1 (usage of binary_double and binray_float supported by the client from 10gR1 but not supported by Oracle 8i and 9i)
            * Fixed memory leak in internal method OCI_StringFromStringPtr() used in OCI_ElemGetString() and OCI_ObjectGetString()
            * Fixed possible memory retention related to OCI Object cache (depending on the Oracle Client version)
 
        - Warning : Programs must be recompiled (with no code change needed) as some methods have been removed from the library

    * C++ API      

        - Enhancements
            * Added abstract Streamable class:
                - It allows derived classes to be compatible with any external stream class supporting the operator << (std::(w)string)
                - The following classes derives now from Streamable : Date, Interval, Timestamp, Collection, Object and Reference
            * Added Support for the enhancements made to the string conversion format in the C API:
                - Added Enum FormatType
                - Added Environment::GetFormat() and Environment::SetFormat()
                - Added Connection::GetFormat() and Connection::SetFormat()
                - Removed Connection::SetDefaultDateFormat() and Connection::GetDefaultDateFormat()
                - Removed Connection::SetDefaultNumericFormat() and Connection::GetDefaultNumericFormat()
            * Added support for Clang C++ compiler 
            * Statement::Bind<>(): Added specializations for Collection and std::vector<Collection<T>> instead of relying on default the implementation that is now removed
            * Added parametrized constructors for Date, Interval and Timestamp classes
            * Made sure that translation from C raw buffer to the C++ Raw class does not fail in case of NULL buffers with non zero size parameter
            * Modified internal access to environment singleton object instance
            * Added enum values for Oracle Versions
            * Added new template methods to Resultset class 
                - Get<T1, T2>() : template method allowing to return a user defined type from a resultset current row content using a translator user defined method/functor/lambda (e.g. return an user defined struct/class from a select on a table)
                - ForEach<T1>() : convenient method wrapping the while(rs.Next)) pattern and that call the an user defined method/functor/lambda for each row fetched
                - ForEach<T1, T2>() : version of ForEach<T1> and Get<T1, T2> combined
                - See the updated main demo application for examples
            * Added template methods Statement::Execute() and Statement::ExecutePrepared():
                - theses overloaded methods can take fetch callbacks and also datatype adapter callbacks
                - It makes the code much compact as it hides the resultset fetch calls
                - It also allow adapting resultsets returned values to user defined types
                - See the updated main demo application for examples
            * Added Resultset::Get<>() overloads with input value arguments to fill instead of returning values. This allow to no specify the data type in the Get<>() call.
                - void Get(unsigned int, TDataType &value) const        
                - void Get(const ostring &name, TDataType &value) const;
                
        - Changes:
            * Exception class  does not derive any more from HandleHolder<>
            * Date::SysDate() is now a static method that returns a now a Date Object with system date time
            * Timestamp::SysTimestamp() is now a static method that returns a now a Timestamp Object with system timestamp
            * Renamed Statement::Execute(void) to ExecutePrepared(void)
            * Added default constructors for classes holding datatypes. 
                - Using the default constructor, we have objects holding no C handles -
                - Their IsNull() properties return is true. 
                - They can now be stored in structures and classes without the need of passing parameters 
                - Their initialization can be deferred from declaration using function return values or using their class constructor with class name
                
        - Fixes        
            * Fixed missing  operator "|" for recently Enum promoted to Flags
            * Fixed HandleHolder<>::operator bool
            * Fixed Statement::Prepare() and Statement::Execute() : when called again for the same object, the internal map of binds was not cleared although bind objects were freed, leading to a segfault
            * Fixed Statement::Bind<ostring> : strings binded to statements with Out or InOut direction mode had their content padded up to max provided size after execution
            * Fixed C++03 standard violation : Removed usage of std::vector::data() that was introduced in C++11 in order to be compliant with C++03
            * Fixed Timestamp::SetDate()
            * Removed unimplemented prototype Lob<TLobObjectType>:: operator TLobObjectType()
            * Fixed segfault when Environment::Initialize() fails to load the oci shared library
        - C++ compilers validated versions:
             * Microsoft C++ compiler : all versions from Visual Studio 2008
             * GCC : all versions from 4.1 
             * Clang : all versions from 3.1 
             * OCILIB++ shall also compile with older versions of these compilers and with other C++ compilers, but not tested 
        - Miscellaneous
             * Internal code clean up
             * Updated some demo files

2015-01-13 Version 4.0.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * C API
    
        - Fixed OCI_ObjectGetXXX() and OCI_ObjectSetXXX() : internal access to some field members could cause segfaults with complex object types having deep nested objects
        - Fixed possible segfaults in OCI_Execute() when string input binds are used in Unicode build on Unix platforms if the bind direction is not explicitly set
        - Added error type OCI_ERR_ARG_INVALID_VALUE
           - Input arguments handled as unsigned int value that correspond to a set of possible value are now checked. 
           - If the provided value does not fit within the set of expected values, an error is raised
        - Factorized some internal code using new methods OCI_ExternalSubTypeToSQLType() and OCI_ExternalSubTypeToSQLType()
        - Replaced some TAB occurrences with spaces
        - Internal code cleanup and refactoring

        - Some Enum<> definitions where promoted to Flags<>
        - Fixed possible race condition in internal smart pointer members access in multi-threaded applications
        - Fixed Statement::Bind<ostring>() : inadequate memory allocation parameter in BindAdaptor class constructor initialization
        - Fixed access violation in Pool object destructor when a global Pool object is not explicitly closed and destructor called after Environment::Cleanup()

    * Miscellaneous
    
        - Update Copyright to 2015
        - Fixed some typos in some files

2014-12-10 Version 4.0.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Introducing new C++ API
    
      - Full C API ported to C++
      - Implemented as a small set of header files, no library compilation needed
      - Based on C++ and STL paradigms (Strong typing, templates, containers, RAII, exception handling, operators, stack objects)
      - Based on design patterns (RAII, delegation, reference counting, smart pointers, proxies, singleton)
      - No user dynamic object allocation required
      - The only dependences are : STL and OCILIB C API
      
    * Extended C API
    
      - Removed support for OCI_CHARSET_MIXED
         - This charset mode was introduced in early versions of OCILIB in order to support Unicode Data binding and fetching for Oracle8i that does not support full Unicode
         - It introduced high complexity in OCILIB code and had been source a bugs
         - This releases removes its support and now, OCILIB charset handling is much simpler
         - Thus OCILIB still support :
            - All Oracle versions : OCI_CHARSET_ANSI => ANSI/UTF8 strings (char* )
            - Oracle 9i and above : OCI_CHARSET_WIDE => UTF16/UTF32 strings (wchar_t *)
         
      - Added Support for some Oracle 12cR1 new features:      
          - Added support for "PL/SQL Implicit Results"          
              - No API changes, internal code updates
              - Added demo file          
          - Added Support for "Identity columns" :          
              - Added OCI_ColumnGetPropertyFlags()

          - Added OCI_CollDeleteElem()
          - Added OCI_CollGetCount()     
          - Added OCI_IterGetCurrent()
          - Fixed OCI_IterGetPrev() and OCI_IterGetNext() : Last error flag for OCI_GetLastError() was wrongly set if it returned FALSE 
          - Fixed OCI_ElemGetRaw() : possible segfault could happen
          - Fixed OCI_ElemSetNull() : it was not setting correctly the element indicator for collections of objects
          - Renamed some methods:
              - OCI_CollGetAt() to OCI_CollGetElem()
              - OCI_CollGetAt2() to OCI_CollGetElem2()
              - OCI_CollSetAt() to OCI_CollSetElem().
              - Note that older method names are still supported using #define for backward compatibility reasons 

      - Connection/Session Pools:
          - Fixed OCI_PoolGetConnection() that could return NULL connection handles (particularly when program is using OCI_PoolGetOpenedCount())
          - Removed connection pooling emulation for Oracle 8i
          - Refactored Oracle pooling implementation (code is now simpler and much more robust)

      - Unicode builds:  
          - Fixed LONG data type fetching when using Unicode builds on Unix/Linux platforms. Returned strings could have extraneous trailing characters
          - Fixed Buffer overwrite in OCI_LobRead2() in Unicode builds
          
      - Strings conversions:      
          - Added OCI_ObjectToText()
          - Added OCI_CollToText()
          - Extended OCI_GetString() : supports now all types
          - Extended OCI_ObjectGetString() : supports now all types

          - Added OCI_BindSetNotNullAtPos()
          - Added OCI_BindSetNotNull()
          - Added OCI_GetBindIndex()
		  - Added OCI_ObjectGetRawSize()
		  - Added OCI_ElemGetRawSize()
		  - Added OCI_LobGetConnection()
		  - Added OCI_FileGetConnection()
          - Added compile time (OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE) and runtime (OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME) detection of OCI shared library version for Oracle 12cR1
          - Added new error code OCI_ERR_ITEM_NOT_FOUND
          - Added VS 2013 solutions
          - Important code refactoring

     - Miscellaneous fixes:
          - Fixed OCI_ObjectGetObject() that could cause segfault when an object had 2 members of object type on a row
          - Fixed OCI_IntervalAdd() and OCI_IntervalSubstract() that were not performing OCI calls due to wrong return code initialization
          - Fixed NULL lob handle input checking in OCI_LobWrite() and OCI_LobWrite2()
          - Fixed OCI_PoolGetConnection() prototype : added const qualifier on tag argument
          - Fixed memory usage of internal arrays (for numeric, text and raw types) when using OCI_BAM_INTERNAL bind allocation mode. Memory was not freed when the statement was freed but only at OCI_Cleanup() time.
          - Fixed segfault in OCI_HashCreate() if internal memory allocation failed
          - SQL warnings occurring in OCI_ExecuteXXX() calls were not propagated correctly to the global error handler and couldn't be retrieved with OCI_GetLastError() in OCI_ENV_CONTEXT mode
          - Fixed runtime (OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME) detection of OCI shared library version for Oracle 11gR2 that was reported as OCI 11gR1
          - Fixed segfault if a statement was executing more than once SQL statement with a "returning clause" (since statement cache support). It was due to an nice bug in the OCI client ! 
          - Fixed OCI_BindSetNull() : if called prior executing an insert statement that had OCI_Object handles binded to it, objects content were inserted in the DB instead of NUL
          - Fixed OCI_TimestampGetTimeZoneOffset() : returned offsets may have unattended values if negative
          - Fixed OCI_TypeInfoGet() that was failing if :
              - object had been created with case sensitivity (e.g. using quotes)
              - object were related to the PUBLIC role

2013-03-04 Version 3.12.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Fixed Unicode support (OCI_CHARSET_WIDE and OCI_CHARSET_MIXED)

      - Unix platforms : Fixed OCI_LongWrite() for OCI_CLONG type : string may wrongly be inserted into DB
      - Unix platforms : Fixed OCI_LongRead()  for OCI_CLONG type : strings may contain trailing garbage data
      - Unix platforms : Fixed OCI_LobRead2()  for OCI_CLOB type  : strings may contain trailing garbage data
      - Unix platforms : Fixed OCI_GetString() : strings may be truncated
      - All platforms  : Fixed OCI_GetString() : when column is number based, the string resulting from number conversion may have trailing dot or comma

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Reduced size of buffers used to store string column data when nls_lang is UTF8
      - Fixed error variable checking in internal call OCI_DirPathArrayToStream()

       - Added direct path demo file dirpath_complete.c
       - Updated documentation
       
     * Fixed Direct Path API  
      
       - Fixed direct path logic when stream buffer are too small (OCI_DirPathConvert() returning OCI_DRP_FULL)
       - Fixed direct path logic when conversion and loading errors occur
       - Fixed OCI_DirPathConvert() that support now resuming conversion when an error occurs by fixing values and calling OCI_DirPathConvert() again in default mode (in previous releases duplicated rows were inserted in database)
       - Fixed OCI_DirPathGetErrorRow() and OCI_DirPathGetErrorColumn() that returned zero based row/column indexes instead of being 1 based row/column indexes 
       - Fixed OCI_DirPathSetEntry() : Setting NULL values on column that had decimal/date format throwed an Oracle error
    
    * Fixed Oracle Streams AQ (Advanced Queues) asynchronous notifications :
    
       - Fixed possible race condition in OCI_DequeueSubscribe() that could cause to have the internal callback called before the user callback was assigned to the dequeue object
       
    * Fixed numeric/ string conversions :

       - Fixed OCI_GetInt(), OCI_GetShort(), OCI_GetBigInt() and unsigned versions when the column type was string based (bug in string/number conversion introduced in v3.11.0)

      - Updated OCI_GetDouble(), OCI_GetDouble2(), OCI_GetFloat(), OCI_GetFloat2() : 
          - In previous releases, BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE were fetched as NUMBER and locally converted to native double and float types using Oracle Client API
          - With this release, BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE are directly fetched as native double and float types
      - BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE were not supported in Oracle Objects and Oracle Collections (TYPES, VARRAYs and NESTED TABLES)
          - In previous releases, segfaults could happen when manipulating objects with BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE members or collections of BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE
          - With this release, BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE are fully supported within OCI_Elem and OCI_Object
      - Updated OCI_BindDouble(), OCI_BindArrayOfDoubles(), OCI_BindFloat(), OCI_BindArrayOfFloats() 
          - If the Oracle client supports BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE types (Oracle 10g and above), host double and float variables are binding as BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE instead of NUMBER.
          - This prevent the Oracle client from performing internal conversions. 
      - Enhanced String conversions :
          - When OCILIB has to convert BINARY DOUBLE values to/from strings, it now supports the double type full range of values.
          - OCILIB uses now the C runtime to perform BINARY DOUBLE and BINARY FLOAT conversions to/from strings as the Oracle Client API cannot handle the full double datatype wihtin its string conversion API
 
    * Miscellaneous changes :
    
      - OCI_GetString() : Conversion from numeric types has been rewritten, much cleaner code now
      - Internal numeric types handling (conversions between numeric types, to/from strings) has been rewritten
      - Miscellaneous code updates : OCILIB source code has been tested against various code analysis tools
      - Documentation updates
      - Added pkgconfig support for Unixes/Linux platforms (thanks to Petr Vanek)
          
    * Miscellaneous fixes :
    
      - OCI_GetBatchErrorCount() always returned 0
      - OCI_FileGetDirectory() did not set error flag for OCI_GetLastError()
      - OCI_ElemGetRaw() was setting error flag to TRUE in all cases for OCI_GetLastError()
      - OCI_PoolGetStatementCacheSize() was setting error flag to FALSE in all cases for OCI_GetLastError()
      - OCI_LobRead() and OCI_LobRead2() : In OCI_CHARSET_WIDE and OCI_CHARSET_MIXED builds, values could be truncated with Oracle clients 8i and 9i only
      - OCI_LobWrite2() and OCI_LobAppend2() : returned byte count may not been accurate for CLOB when using OCI_CHARSET_WIDE or OCI_CHARSET_MIXED builds
      - OCI_ColumnGetCharUsed() : Attribute introduced in Oracle 9.2 but OCILIB tried to retrieve it from Oracle 9.0 as well
      - OCI_ConnectionFree() could generate a segfault on a reused connection retrieved from a connection pool since version 3.10.0
      - OCI_TypeInfoGet() could generate a segfault in OCI_CHARSET_WIDE builds when a table/view column or object member was an Oracle Type (Object and Collection)
      - OCI_xxxFmt() calls : Timestamp arguments were not formatted correctly (missing quotes in the formatted SQL)     
      - Scrollable Statements : 
          - An Oracle error (ORA-01001 or ORA-01002) was thrown when fetching a statement (PL/SQL Cursor or Nested table) that was returned by a select statement that contained more than one column
          - This happened only if the statement was retrieved from a scrollable statement using array fetching (internal OCILIB default behavior)
          - This is an Oracle bug and a workaround has been found
          - Now, OCILIB internally sets the resultset internal array size to 1 and thus ignore any values set using OCI_SetFetchSize() for such statements

    * Modified Prebuilt MS Windows binaries
    
      - Official Windows OCILIB Binaries are now built using MS C compiler optimization capabilities (compiler remains MS Visual Studio 2010 Express) :
          - Full optimization compiler flag (/Ox)
          - Whole program optimization flag (/GL)
        
2012-08-08 Version 3.10.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Added support for native C float datatype :

      - Added OCI_GetFloat()
      - Added OCI_GetFloat2()
      - Added OCI_BindFloat()
      - Added OCI_BindArrayOfFloats()
      - Added OCI_RegisterFloat()
      - Added OCI_ElemGetFloat()
      - Added OCI_ElemSetFloat()
      - Added OCI_ObjectGetFloat()
      - Added OCI_ObjectSetFloat()
      - Added constant OCI_ARG_FLOAT
      - Added constant OCI_NUM_FLOAT
      - Use the input identifier '%g' for OCI_StmtxxxxFmt() calls when passing float variables
      - Updated demo application to use float datatype 
      
    * Fixed OCI_IntervalArrayCreate() : wrong internal handle type caused the function to fail to allocate the array with the right interval type
      
2012-06-29 Version 3.9.4 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Connection and Session Pools : Fixed few bugs related to OCILIB automatic adaptation to runtime client versions and features that could lead OCI_PoolGetConnection() to return NULL
      - Statement cache was not properly activated when feature was available
      - OCI_PoolGetStatementCacheSize() : an error was raised as an invalid internal OCI attribute code was used
      - Fixed broken compilation support for Oracle 8i and 9i clients on Unix platforms when oracle shared lib import mode is OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE
      - Oracle 11g : OCILIB driver name could not be properly set in the view V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO
      - Oracle XA :
          - Unix platforms : No change, XA is supported for all Oracle Clients >= 8i
          - MS Windows Platforms :
              * When using the DLLs provided in OCILIB releases, XA wis now enabled only if the Oracle client loaded at runtime has XA symbols embedded in oci.dll (usually >= Oracle 10g)
              * When compiling yourself OCILIB, support is enabled only with Oracle Client 10g and above as on MS Windows, for 8i and 9i, specific import libraries are used and can be missing in some installations             
              * So when XA is not enabled, using the flag OCI_SESSION_XA with OCI_ConnectionCreate() will now throw an exception
     
    * Miscellaneous changes
    
      - default transaction behavior :
      
          - Prior to v3.9.4, a default transaction object was created in OCI_ConnectionCreate() and associated to the returned connection object. 
          - From v3.9.4
              * No changes for regular standalone transactions and transactions retrieved from connection pool.
              * For XA connections and connections retrieved from session pool, no transaction object is created anymore and thus, OCI_GetTransaction() will return NULL for newly created connections.
              * Note that transaction objects must not be set to connections retrieved from a session pool or to XA connections
              * For other types of connections (regular or retrieved from connection pool), transaction objects can be used as normal
      
      - Various internal minor code change
      - Note that all sources files have been updated to include year 2012 in the copyright section 
       
2011-12-05 Version 3.9.3 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed broken support for Oracle 8i client since v3.9.0
      - Fixed OCI_ObjectSetObject() : a bug had been introduced in v3.8.1 when computing internal object structure offsets and paddings 
      - Fixed OCI_LobRead(), OCI_LobRead2() : in OCI_CHARSET_WIDE charset builds only, a segfault could happen caused by an internal buffer overwrite    
      - Fixed OCI_SetStatementCacheSize(), OCI_GetStatementCacheSize() : an error ORA-24315 (with no incidence) could be thrown by some versions of Oracle clients
      - Fixed OCI_BindXXX() : All binding methods returned TRUE instead of FALSE when an exception OCI_ERR_MAX_BIND occurred
      - Fixed OCI_GetString() : an error OCI-22061 was happening when the column was numeric and a user defined numeric format where provided with OCI_SetDefaultFormatNumeric()
      - Fixed OCI_GetServerRevisionVersion() : it was returned the same value as OCI_GetServerMajorVersion() since v3.4.0
      - Fixed internal method OCI_ParseSqlFmt() used in OCI_xxxFmt() calls : Quoted strings were not properly output since v3.9.0
      - Fixed internal allocation mode : 

          - some OCI_BindXXX() calls were not compatible with OCI_BAM_INTERNAL allocation mode and when used with it, were causing segfaults if the host variable parameter was NULL
          - now these methods raise an OCI_ERR_NULL_POINTER error if the host variable parameter is NULL and the statement bind allocation mode is set to OCI_BAM_INTERNAL

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - OCILIB library compilation

          - Modified compile time detection of OCI client version when using OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE as Oracle back ported some defines introduced at version (X) in patches for version (X-1) !

      - OCILIB documentation

         - Updated Bind allocation mode description : added list of incompatible OCI_BindXXX() methods
         - Added OCI_BAM_INTERNAL compatibility information in all OCI_BindXXX calls() documentation
         - Added OCI_ENV_EVENTS requirements for subscriptions and HA methods
         - Minor changes

     - few code internal minor changes

     - Removed in each OCILIB source file, the version number and date time (updated at each new release, using diff tools was a nightmare !)

2011-07-13 Version 3.9.2 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Detection of the 'long long' type on Unix/Linux platforms is now working as expected in all situations
      - version 3.9.0 broke support of Oracle client versions < 10g when using OCI import mode OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE (default option on Unix/Linux platforms)

2011-07-08 Version 3.9.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed OCI_BindString() : version 3.9.0 introduced a memory leak when using this method
      - Fixed OCI_IsNull()     : version 3.7.0 introduced a bug when OCI_IsNull() was called for OCI_CDT_OBJECT columns. It always returned FALSE
      - Fixed OCI_GetStruct()  : version 3.7.0 introduced a bug (same as above) that caused the indicator array parameter filled with wrong indicator values for OCI_CDT_OBJECT columns
      - Fixed use of "Returning into" SQL clause : version 3.9.0 broke re-execution of a prepared statement that contains a "returning into" SQL clause

2011-04-20 Version 3.9.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Added support Oracle XA

      - Oracle XA integration in OCLIB is transparent by using OCI_ConnectionCreate() and requires just :
      
         - an XA db name for parameter 'db'
         - an extra flag OCI_SESSION_XA for parameter 'mode'
         - no user or password
          
      - See the OCI_ConnectionCreate() documentation for the XA open string needed by OCILIB to pass to the TMP 

    * Added support for statement cache

      - Statement cache is now automatically enabled when using an Oracle client >= 9iR2
      - Added statement cache size customization when using an Oracle client >= 10gR1 :
        
        - Added OCI_SetStatementCacheSize()
        - Added OCI_GetStatementCacheSize()
        - Added OCI_PoolSetStatementCacheSize()
        - Added OCI_PoolGetStatementCacheSize()

    * Added support for TAF (Transparent Application Failover) and HA (High Availability) 
    
      - The following handler has been added when using an Oracle client >= 10gR2

        - Added OCI_IsTAFCapable()
        - Added OCI_SetTAFHandler()
        - Added OCI_SetHAHandler()

    * Added support for Connection attributes introduced in Oracle 10gR2

      - Added OCI_GetServiceName()
      - Added OCI_GetServerName()
      - Added OCI_GetDomainName()
      - Added OCI_GetInstanceStartTime()

    * Improved bind tuning. Now it is possible to set the bind direction mode (in, out, in/out) for slightly better performance 
    
      - Added OCI_BindSetDirection()
      - Added OCI_BindGetDirection()

    * Miscellaneous new calls :

      -  Added OCI_Describe() and OCI_DescribeFmt() to enable the retrieving of an OCI_Resultset object for 'select' statement wihtout exectuing the SQL

    * Miscellaneous changes :

      - Re-enforced checks on OCI_Statement handle related methods that checks the statement state (prepared, executed, parsed,...) that now can throw more exceptions
      - Updated layout of some internal structure to suppress unnecessary padding
      - Manual update of source code formatted with Uncrustify (wrong indentation of preprocessor directives)
      - User callbacks were not correctly documented
      - Updated Doxygen version used to generate the documentation (update in the output HTML style)

    * Miscellaneous fixes :

      - Fixed Binding call using the binding mode OCI_BAM_INTERNAL :

        - arrays of Lobs, Files, Intervals and timestamps : internal objects were not properly initialized
        - big_int : single bind and array bind were incorrectly implemented (allocation size wrongly computed that lead to a segfault for arrays)	
        - strings : 
          
          - single binds : if the length parameter was set to 0, a segfault happened 
          - Wide strings : if the native Oracle Unicode used a different size than the C runtime for wchar_t (like Unix like system) translation were not performed by OCILIB 

      - Fixed 11Gr2 compile time detection when using OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE (default on Unix platform)   
      - Fixed OCI_ImmediateFmt() : the method returned FALSE even on success
      - Fixed OCI_PoolGetConnection() : OCILIB tried to set the driver name attribute (appeared in 10gR2) on the session that is not allowed anymore in 11g
      - Fixed OCI_SetFormatDate() macro : fixed macros parameters declaration
      - Fixed OCI_ColumnGetNullable() returned value
      - Fixed OCI_ConnectionCreate() : 2 OCI handles not freed if connection failed
      - Fixed OCI_SetPrefetchSize(), OCI_SetPrefetchMemory() : the given value was not really passed to Oracle
      - Fixed OCI_TypeInfoGet() called internally when fetching object owned by a different schema
      - Fixed OCI_Parse() : the method was internally doing a describe operation instead of just a parse (which gave same results from an end user view)
      - Fixed OCI_LobAssign() that was not handling correctly Lob arrays created with OCI_LobArrayCreate()
      - Fixed OCI_BindDouble() and OCI_BindArrayOfDoubles() : internal sub numeric type OCI_NUM_DOUBLE was not set on the bind handle
      - Fixed OCI_StringGetFromAttrHandle() allocation of insufficient buffer in Unicode mode
      - Fixed OCI_ObjectSetxxx() could return true if attribute not found
      - Fixed Queues function in OCI_CHARSET_MIXED mode

2010-12-13 Version 3.8.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed internal computation of OCI_Object attributes null indicator offsets
      - Fixed OCI_Elem handle initialization by OCI_CollGetAt() and OCI_CollGetAt2()
      - Fixed OCI_Ping() : OCI symbol OCIPing() was not dynamically loaded if OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME was used (default for pre-compiled MS Windows DLLs)
      - Fixed OCI_ConnectionCreate() : in case of an unsuccessful attempt to create a connection, an OCI internal handle was not freed since v3.7.0 (-> memory leak)
      - Fixed OCI_LongWrite()   + OCI_CHARSET_WIDE charset mode : internal length passed to internal OCI calls was expressed in chars instead of bytes
      - Fixed OCI_TypeInfoGet() + OCI_TYF_TYPE : an Oracle error was raised when passing as type name a built-in system type like "SYS.RAW"
      - Fixed OCI_GetLastError() that could return NULL when errors occurred in OCI_FetchXXX() calls (although the global error handler was correctly fired) 
      - Fixed OCI_DequeueGet() : a segfault happened if the queue payload was of type RAW 
      - Fixed OCI_DequeueFree() : internal structure member that hold the value set by OCI_DequeueSetConsumer() was not freed (memory leak)
      - Fixed OCI_MsgFree() : internal message ID allocated at enqueue time by OCI_EnqueuePut() was not freed (memory leak)
      - Fixed OCI_IterFree() : internal OCI_Elem handle was not freed for local collections resulting a small memory leak
      - Fixed OCI_EnqueuePut() and OCI_DequeueGet() : possible memory leak on Unix platforms + OCI_CHARSET_WIDE/OCI_CHARSET_MIXED charset mode
      - Fixed OCI_DequeueFree() : Internal OCI_Msg handle deallocation forgot to deallocate internal message ID resulting a small memory leak
      - Fixed OCI_SetPassword() and OCI_SetUserPassword() : in OCI_CHARSET_WIDE and OCI_CHARSET_MIXED builds, theses functions failed to change the password
      - Fixed OCI_LobRead2() and OCI_LobWrite2() that could block when using UTF8 through NLS_LANG environment variable
      - Fixed OCI_GetStruct() : structure padding was not handled properly
      - Fixed internal allocation of ROWID and UROWID internal buffers when using UTF8 through NLS_LANG environment variable

    * Miscellaneous changes

      - Added Exception type OCI_ERR_REBIND_BAD_DATATYPE if a rebinding call attempts to bind a datatype different than the initial one
      - Updated documentation about datatypes for rebinding
      - Added support for numeric subtypes in OCI_BindGetSubtype() + documentation update
      - Manual update of source code formatted with Uncrustify (wrong indentation of witch case and some variable initialization)
      - Pre built MS Windows 32/64bits DLLs are now built using MS Visual Studio 2010 Express (instead of MS Visual Studio 2008 Professional)
      - A MS Visual Studio 2010 Express solution and project has been added to the Windows package to rebuild the DLLs

      - Source code max line length have been modified (80 -> 100 characters)

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed memory leak : if an OCI_Bindxxx() returned FALSE (eg. non present binds in the SQL statement), the newly internal allocated bind object was not freed
      - Fixed possible segfault in OCI_Cleanup() if OCI_SubscriptionRegister() had been previously called call unsuccessfully
      - Fixed internal array allocation when using OCI_ArraySetSize() called many times on the same prepared SQL statement
      - Fixed OCI_ElemGetTimeStamp() and OCI_ElemGetInterval() when collections are retrieved from the server 
      - Fixed possible segfault in OCI_TimestampFromCTime() and OCI_TimestampFromCTime() if the libc function localtime() returns a NULL tm structure pointer
      - Fixed OCI_GetSessionTag() linkage : the function was internally named OCI_GetSessionData() instead of OCI_GetSessionTag() in connection.c
      - Fixed binding of date arrays : the introduction of OCI_XXXArrayCreate() in v3.6.0 has introduced a bug in dates array binding that would cause to pass NULL data for some elements of the array
      - Fixed some API naming inconstancy (lower/upper case)

        - OCI_ElemGetTimeStamp()      renamed to OCI_ElemGetTimestamp()
        - OCI_ObjectGetTimeStamp()    renamed to OCI_ObjectGetTimestamp()
        - OCI_TimestampSysTimeStamp() renamed to OCI_TimestampSysTimestamp()
        - Macros have been added for backward compatibility

        - Existing programs must be recompiled (in order to use this new version of ocilib) with no code change (as compatibility macros are provided)
  

2010-07-26 Version 3.7.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@ocilib.net

    * Added support for Session Pools

      - Added support for Oracle Session pools :

        - This features has been introduced in Oracle 9.2
        - For Oracle clients < 9.2, sessions are handled as regular connection pools

      - Renamed type OCI_ConnPool to OCI_Pool
      - Renamed all OCI_ConnPooXXX() calls to OCI_PoolXXX()
      - Added macros that maps old OCI_ConnPoolXXX() prototypes to OCI_PoolXXX() functions
      - Added new parameter 'type' to OCI_PoolCreate(). Possible values are

        - OCI_POOL_CONNECTION : creates a connection pool
        - OCI_POOL_SESSION    : creates a session pool

      - Added support for session pool tagging:

        - Added OCI_GetSessionTag()
        - Added OCI_SetSessionTag()

      - Added new parameter 'tag' to OCI_PoolGetConnection() 

      - Updated documentation:

        - Renamed page <module>, section <Connection pooling> to <Oracle pooling>
        - Added Information about session pooling

    * Extended fetch interface

      - Added OCI_GetStruct()
      - Added OCI_SetStructNumericType()
      - Added demo file fetch_struct.c

    * Improved Execute/Fetch performance with prepared statement

      - Improved by x15 fetch performance when executing and fetching prepared statements that return resultsets
      
          - Prior to v3.7.0 :

              - Before a prepared statement was re-executed, any previous resultset was freed
              - Then, once the statement was re-executed, the resultset was recreated by OCI_GetResultset()

          - From v3.7.0 :

              - The resultset is created only once and is just reinitialized before re-execution
              - Avoiding these unnecessary memory allocations/deallocations improves drastically the performances

    * Extended Array interface

      - Modified connection internal handles allocation/deallocation: 

         - Server handle is now allocated/deallocated when physical connection to server is created/freed
         - Session and context handles are now allocated/deallocated at logon/logoff time
         - Before theses handles were all allocated/deallocated when physical connection to server was created/freed

      - Depending on the database charset :
    
          - UTF8 : UTF8 strings are used for any text based binds or retrieved columns values
          - Other charsets : UTF8 strings can be used only with national strings (NCHAR/NVARCHAR/NCLOB)

    * Extended String support

      - Added OCI_BindSetCharsetForm() to enable the use of national charset on binded strings

    * Extended LOB API

      - Various documentation updates
      - Modified OCI_LobRead() (and thus OCI_LobRead2()) to set a trailing null character
      - Replaced few left direct malloc() calls by OCI_MemAlloc()

      - If client version >= 11.1, OCILIB Resultsets allocate internal OCI descriptors array in one call (lobs, files, timestamp and interval)
 
    * Information : OCI_DatabaseStartup() fails on Unicode builds because OCI function OCIDBStartup() fails if OCI is initialized in UTF16 mode ! Another bug to report to Oracle !

        * OCI_ElemSetFile()
        * OCI_ElemSetLob()
        * OCI_ElemSetRef()
   
    * Extended Bind informations

      - Modified : OCI_Bind handles are now public and can be retrieved for public information
      - Added OCI_GetBindCount()
      - Added OCI_GetBind()
      - Added OCI_GetBind2()
      - Added OCI_BindGetName()
      - Added OCI_BindGetType()
      - Added OCI_BindGetSubtype()
      - Added OCI_BindGetStatement()
      - Added OCI_BindGetData()
      - Added OCI_BindGetDataCount()
      - Added OCI_BindGetDataSize()
      - Added OCI_BindGetDataSizeAtPos()
      - Added OCI_BindSetDataSize()
      - Added OCI_BindSetDataSizeAtPos()
      - Added OCI_SetNull2()
      - Added OCI_SetNullAtPos2()
      - Extended OCIBindxxx() calls safety : 

        * An error OCI_ERR_BIND_ALREADY_USED is now raised if the bind name or position is already binded to the statement
        * With the bind mode by position, provided bind indexes <= 0  and > OCI_BIND_MAX will cause an error OCI_ERR_OUT_OF_BOUNDS

      - Extended binds/registers limits :
 
        * OCI implements the SQL returning clause through binds operations
        * OCILIB wraps the result of the returning clause within OCI_Resultet object but has to use internal binds to create its resultset
        * Prior to v3.1.0, OCI_BIND_MAX (default 512) was the maximum of OCI_Bindxxx() including OCI_Registerxxx() that an OCI_Statement could handle
        * With v3.1.0, OCILIB can handle OCI_BIND_MAX user binds handle and OCI_BIND_MAX items in the returning clause

    * Fixed Unicode support for Unixes platforms

        * Unicode support for platforms with 4 bytes wchar_t was broken
        * Fixed configure script was setting bad charset macros
        * Fixed some internal buffer expansion functions

    * Miscellaneous public modifications

      - Added OCI_IsNull2()
      - Added OCI_ResultsetGetStatement()
      - Added OCI_BindArrayOfColls()
      - Added OCI_GetDataLength()
  
      - Added functions to retrieve OCI_Schema object from various OCILIB object bases on Oracle object type :

        * Added OCI_ObjectGetSchema()
        * Added OCI_CollGetSchema()
        * Added OCI_RefGetSchema()

      - Added runtime information about OCILIB builds modes :

        * Added OCI_GetImportMode()
        * Added OCI_GetCharsetMetaData()
        * Added OCI_GetCharsetUserData()

      - On Oracle versions >= 11g, OCILIB now sets the client driver layer name information

        * Value set to the constant OCILIB_DRIVER_NAME (by default "OCILIB") 
        * It is recorded in the system views V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO and GV$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO

      - Modified ocilib demo to properly support MinGw and Unix based Unicode console output

    * Miscellaneous internal modifications

      - Added internal reference counter to OCI_Schema object 

        * Some OCILIB objects keep a pointer to some OCI_schema objects
        * If OCI_SchemaFree() was called, these objects were holding a reference to a freed block of memory and then accessing this reference could cause a segfault
        * Now OCI_SchemaFree() only frees an schema object if its reference counter is zero.
       
    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - OCI_FetchPrev() was returning FALSE if called directly after OCI_FetchLast() on resultsets with less then OCI_FETCH_SIZE rows (default set to 20)
      - if OCI_FetchXXX calls were returning FALSE, internal error flag was wrongly set to TRUE and OCI_GetLastError() could return a previous OCI_Error handle
      - OCI_Fetchxxx() functions could return TRUE even if the given SQL statement had some SQL conversion function that failed (like to_date(), etc..)
      - OCI_Getxxx() functions could cause a segfault called before any OCI_Fetchxxx() calls 
      - OCI_IsConnected() was always returning FALSE since v3.0.0
      - OCI_SchemaGet() with OCI_SCHEMA_TABLE was causing an ORA-24328 with Oracle 8 and 9 (working fine with Oracle 10) since v3.0.0
      - OCI_Execute() could raise an ORA-01483 if an OCI_Timestamp handle of type OCI_TIMESTAMP, initialized with OCI_TimestampSysTimeStamp() only, was binded to the statement
      - Fixed OCI_TimestampIntervalAdd() and OCI_TimestampIntervalSub() that might have raised errors with OCI_Timestamp handles of type OCI_TIMESTAMP
      - Fixed some preprocessor directives in oci_loader.h
      - Fixed OCI_Object re-usability: internal sub object could not be freed when fetching next object and thus lead to memory leaks
      - Since v3.0.0, fetching LONG column with OCI_LONG_IMPLICIT mode was truncating data to its half length in Unicode and Mixed Builds 
      - Fixed some preprocessor directives for MinGw support
      - Fixed runtime loading of oracle libs that might have not worked if the provided OCI library location ended with an existing slash
      - Fixed internal OCI_CopyString() that might caused some troubles in Unicode builds 
      - Fixed some internal wrong arrays size used for memory allocation
      - Fixed some OCI_Date and OCI_Timestamp decode functions to work properly on big-endian platforms
      - Fixed string binding on mixed charset build with Oracle 8i
      - since v3.0.0, OCILIB source compilation was broken for oracle 8i
      - Fixed demo file output.c

2008-10-17 Version 3.0.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Added checks (OCI_ERR_MIN_VALUE) on len parameter (len >=1) of OCI_LobRead(), OCI_LobApend(), OCI_LobWrite(), OCI_FileRead()
      - Compilation of ocilib source with MSCV6++ was broken (vsnprintf was not defined to _vsnprintf anymore)
      - Memory leak : internal bind data allocated for handling PL/SQL tables was never freed 
      - Memory leak : internal OCI_Elem object used by OCI_Coll was never freed
      - Memory leak : since v3.0.0,  OCI_Statement internal stored SQL command string was not freed anymore
      - Scrollable cursors : executing a non select query on a scrollable statement was causing an oracle error

    * The library has been re-tested with various test suites under valgrind to check memory handling and it is now clean !

    * Massive Library rewrite:

      - Update OCILIB Full Name from "OCILIB (C Wrapper for Oracle OCI)" to "OCILIB - C Driver for Oracle"
      - Split OCILIB main source file into 30 source files
      - All public and internal functions have been partially / largely reorganized / rewritten  
      - Miscellaneous code optimization, enhancement and cleanup
      - OCILIB source code compilation produces zero warnings with highest warning settings of GCC and Microsoft C compiler
      - Note for GCC builds :

        * OCILIB static/shared libs are now bigger because of the split sources and the autotools default CFLAG set to "-g -02"
        * Stripping the library (using the command strip) will make it 3 times smaller.

      - Standardization of functions implementation:
      
        * 1 - Checks
        * 2 - Function code
        * 3 - thread error status (optional)
        * 4 - Single exit point
        
      - OCILIB main header file (ocilib.h) moved from folder ./src to folder ./include. 

        - For MS windows users, do not forget to update your compiler/IDE settings for include paths
 
    * Extended error handling

      - Updated section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Error handling>)
      - Major rewrite for the internal error handling code
      - Added support for thread contextual error handling
      
        * New Flag OCI_ENV_CONTEXT for OCI_Initialize()
        * Added OCI_GetLastError()
        
      - Enforced input parameter checking
      - Added OCI_GetSqlErrorPos() to retrieve the position error in a SQL statement
      - Now, OCILIB calls guaranties to raise an error in any situation where it should instead of just returning to caller as it was doing before
      - Added some Memory checking:

        * OCILIB now keeps counts of all internal allocated OCI handles, descriptors and objects
        * OCI_Cleanup() will throw an error in case of unfreed OCI object and returns FALSE
     
      - Modified return values for OCi_ErrorGetType() :
      
        * OCI_ERR_ORACLE : OCI calls error, SQL errors, ...
        * OCI_ERR_OCILIB : internal OCILIB and application logic errors
        
      - New exceptions are raised:
      
        * OCI_ERR_NONE                : "No error"
        * OCI_ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED     : "OCILIB has not been initialized"
        * OCI_ERR_LOADING_SHARED_LIB  : "Cannot load OCI shared library (%lib_name%)"
        * OCI_ERR_LOADING_SYMBOLS     : "Cannot load OCI symbols from shared library"
        * OCI_ERR_MULTITHREADED       : "OCILIB has not been initialized in multi-threaded mode"
        * OCI_ERR_MEMORY              : "Memory allocation failure (type %type_name%, size : %block_size%)"  
        * OCI_ERR_NOT_AVAILABLE       : "Feature not available (%feature_name%) "
        * OCI_ERR_NULL_POINTER        : "A null %type_name% has been provided"
        * OCI_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED       : "Oracle datatype not supported (SQL code %oracle_code%) " (currently only REFs are not supported)
        * OCI_ERR_PARSE_TOKEN         : "Unknown identifier %token% while parsing SQL"
        * OCI_ERR_MAP_ARGUMENT        : "Unknown argument %arg_code% while retrieving data"
        * OCI_ERR_OUT_OF_BOUNDS       : "Index %value% out of bounds. Must be between %min% and %max%"
        * OCI_ERR_UNFREED_DATA        : "Found %nb% unfreed %data_type%"
        * OCI_ERR_MAX_BIND            : "Maximum number of binds (%limit%) already reached" (currently 512)
        * OCI_ERR_ATTR_NOT_FOUND      : "Object attribute '%name%' not found"
        * OCI_ERR_MIN_VALUE           : "The integer parameter value must be at least %min%"
        * OCI_ERR_NOT_COMPATIBLE      : "Elements are not compatibles (type 1 = %typecode1%, type 2 = %typecode2%)"
        * OCI_ERR_STMT_STATE          : "Unable to perform this operation on a %stmt_state% statement"
        * OCI_ERR_STMT_NOT_SCROLLABLE : "The statement is not scrollable"

      - The exception OCI_ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED is only available with OCI_GetLastError(), even 
        if OCI_ENV_CONTEXT is not used with OCI_Initialize(), and is raised when calling OCI_XXXXCreate()
        to allocate OCILIB handles before any call to OCI_Initialize()

    * Extended implicit datatype conversions

      - Added OCI_SetDefaultFormatNumeric()
      - Added OCI_GetDefaultFormatNumeric()
      - Added OCI_SetDefaultFormatDate()
      - Added OCI_GetDefaultFormatDate()
      - Modified OCI_SetFormatDate() and OCI_GetFormatDate() that now are macro for compatibility with older code
      - Added support for implicit conversion:

        * String columns can be retrieved as numeric data
        * OCI_GetString() and OCI_GetString() can return string data whatever the real type of the column (except for Object, Collection and Cursor based columns)

    * Improved internal numeric datatypes handling

      - Modified : public OCILIB datatype OCI_CDT_INTEGER and OCI_CDT_DOUBLE has been replaced by one datatype : OCI_CDT_NUMERIC
      - Modified : Now, all fetched numeric columns are internally mapped to OCINumber OCI type and to public type OCI_CDT_NUMERIC
      - Modified : Much cleaner, compact an easier code for handling OCI_GetXXXX() calls for all numeric types
                    
    * Extended Date, timestamp and interval support

      - Added OCI_TimestampGetDateTime()
      - Added checks for securing input integer pointer :

        * OCI_DateGetTime(), OCI_DateGetDate(), OCI_DateGetDateTime()
        * OCI_TimestampGetTime(), OCI_TimestampGetDate(), OCI_TimestampGetDateTime(), OCI_TimestampGetTimeZoneOffset()
        * OCI_IntervalGetDaySecond(), OCI_IntervalGetYearMonth()

    * Extended OCILIB documentation that has been updated and some precisions has been added:

      - Added    : page <module> - section <PL/SQL support> with new code examples
      - Added    : page <module> - section <Collections (Varrays and Nested Tables> with new code examples
      - Extended : page <module> - section <Error handling> for thread contextual error handling
      - Extended : page <module> - section <Fetching data> for scrollable cursors and string conversions
      - Extended : page <module> - section <Library objects and datatypes>) for supported datatypes
      - Updated  : page <module> - section <Charset support>
      - Modified : page <module> - section <Build Options> content moved to page <module> - section <Installing OCILIB>
      - Updated  : miscellaneous changes
         
    * Miscellaneous changes

      - Modified : up to 110 various functions prototypes have been modified to change the type of the return value or some parameters from int -> unsigned int
      - Modified : OCI_GetResultset() returns now the first resultset if it exists instead of creating a new one
      - Modified : OCI_SetNull() and OCI_SetNullAtPos() : now indexes and positions start at 1
      - Modified : OCI_BIND_MAX (maximum number of binds for a statement) is now 512 by default instead of 256
      - Modified : OCI_BindArraySetSize() : parameter nbelem type modified from 'int' to 'unsigned int'
      - Modified : OCI_HashGetEntry() : now indexes and positions start at 1
      - Modified : Rearranged internal structures to respect alignment and avoid padding
      - Modified : OCI_HashGetEntry() : now indexes and positions start at 1
      - Modified : return value in case of failure for OCI_TransactionGetMode() [OCI_ERROR->OCI_UNKNOWN] and OCI_TransactionGetTimeout() [OCI_ERROR -> 0]
      - Modified : OCI_GetColumnXXX() calls are now renamed to OCI_ColumnGetXXX() and old prototypes are maintained as macros for backward compatibility
      - Added    : OCI_StatementGetConnection()
      - Added    : OCI_ColumnGetSchema()
      - Added    : OCI_ColumnGetSubType()
      - Added    : support for MSVC6++/Unicode builds

        * Inclusion of wchar.h is now done in extern C++ block for MSVC6++ and cpp applications
        * swprintf() is mapped to _snwprintf() because VC6 C-library is not ISO C compliant
 
    * Fixed some Connection pools problems
 
      - Fixed : Connection pools : every call to OCI_ConnPoolGetConnection() was allocating internal data instead of using existing ones.
      - Fixed : Memory leak : internal connection transaction handle was never freed
      - Fixed : OCI_ConnPoolCreate() : parameter 'incr_con' was not used (value '1' used instead)

    * Fixed some PL/SQL table problems
 
      - Fixed : PL/SQL table pure IN binds was causing PL/SQL error when the table parameters was accessed by PL/SQL procedures
      - Fixed : Passing the value 1 for array size in PL/SQL tables binds caused an ORA-06550
  
    * Fixed Oracle Long fetching

      - Segmentation fault was happening if a select contained a LONG column + other columns
      - Unnecessary reallocation of internal LONG buffers was done at every internal fetch call (by default every 20 rows)
      - When using OCI_LONG_IMPLICIT (LONG mapped to VARCHAR), strings returned by OCI_GetString() might not have their final null character
       
    * Modified GNU configure scripts

      - Added    : For GNU builds added configure option --with-custom-loader for platforms that are not using '-ldl' (if using option --with-oracle-linkage=runtime)
      - Fixed    : Some configure options were broken
      - Modified : Added some checks and some outputs

    * Miscellaneous fixes

      - Fixed : Replaced any references of 'long' C type with 'int' C types in Unix wchar internal conversion functions (on 64bits platforms, 
                sizeof(long) is 8 bytes so it lead to some buffer bad alignment)
      - Fixed : Second parameter 'ptm' of OCI_DateToCTime() and OCI_TimestampToCTime() was not mandatory as it should have been
      - Fixed : Unicode buffer conversion : Internal OCI_StringLength() could not work properly on some architectures
      - Fixed : Binding 64bits integers was not working properly (wrong internal flags)
      - Fixed : OCI_ObjectGetShort() and OCI_ObjectGetUnsignedShort() were missing in ocilib.c
      - Fixed : the header "limits.h" was not included in ocilib.h and on some configurations the support of 'long long' could not be detected
      - Fixed : CLOBs read/writes on OCILIB Unix/Unicode builds could not work properly (wrong buffer passed to OCI)
      - Fixed : OCI_SetUserData() was not exported
      - Fixed : return value of the declaration of OCI_GetVersionConnection() was wrong (boolean instead of unsigned int)
      - Fixed : OCI_ServerEnableOutput() and OCI_ServerDisableOutput() prototypes did not have the OCI_API call convention (for MS builds)
      - Fixed : OCI_ObjectGetString() prototype was returning wrong type 'mtext *' instead of 'dtext *'

    * Updated main demo application

      - Added : Example for scrollable cursors and collections (varrays and nested tables)
      - Fixed : some bad cast could lead buffer bad filling in mixed charset build

    * Fixed Mixed charset builds (OCI_CHARSET_MIXED ONLY)

      - Fixed : OCI_ObjectGetString() and OCI_ObjectSetString() were misunderstanding string buffers
      - Fixed : OCI_ServerEnableOutput() was not allocating enough memory to hold output buffer lines
      - Info  : OCILIB functions using the OCI functions OCIStringPtr() and OCIStringAssignText() have a limitation on mixed charset builds :

        * In mixed builds, OCILIB Strings (dtext *) used for handling user data are wchar_t strings, but the underlying OCI API 
          understands theses strings as not Unicode but ANSI or other encoding 
        * So, there is now, when building OCILIB with OCI_CHARSET_MIXED, an internal conversion to/from ANSI data when using :
          
          - OCI_ObjectGetString() and OCI_ObjectSetString()
          - OCI_ElemGetString() and OCI_ElemSetString()

2008-07-24 Version 2.5.1 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Fixed : OCILIB builds with Runtime loading of OCI shared library activated

      - Loading dynamically OCIMutexXXX() functions was broken with v2.5.0
      - Runtime loading of the OCI shared library on Unix-like platforms was broken with v2.5.0

    * Fixed Unicode builds: 

      - Binding C Unicode strings (wchar_t *) to PL/SQL tables of char/varchar was throwing an PLS-00418 error 
      - The internal buffer expansion (for Unix-like platforms where wchar_t is 4 bytes) could mess up the data for arrays of string binds
      - OCI_ConnPoolGetConnection() could return NULL with an Oracle 8i client if OCILIB was built with an OCI version >= 8 or with OCI_IMPORT_RUNTIME option

2008-07-21 Version 2.5.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Added support for PL/SQL tables (PL/SQL arrays)

      - Bind (input, output) C arrays to PL/SQL using OCI_BindArrayOfxxx() functions
      - All the OCI_BindArrayOfxxx() functions take now an extra parameter : the size of the array for PL/PL/SQL table
      - For regular array interface bind, pass 0 for the array size which is set by OCI_BindArraySetSize() 

    * Extended Date, timestamp and interval support

      - Added OCI_DateGetDateTime()
      - Added OCI_DateSetDateTime()
      - Added support for converting C types (time_t, tm) to/from OCI_Date and OCI_Timestamp :

        * Added OCI_DateFromCTime()
        * Added OCI_DateToCTime()
        * Added OCI_TimestampFromCTime()
        * Added OCI_TimestampToCTime()

      - Date, timestamp and interval can now be create outside a database connection:
            
        * To create a connection independent object, pass a NULL OCI_Connection pointer to OCI_DateCreate(), OCI_TimestampCreate() and OCI_intervalCreate() functions
        * Keep in mind that using a connection pointer is still recommended because it is checking that the server is able to handle these datatypes

      - Fixed OCI_TimestampIntervalAdd(), OCI_TimestampIntervalSub() : 

        * If the timestamps type was not OCI_TIMESTAMP_TZ, an error occurred
        * Now, these functions changes the timestamps types for OCI raw call and set it back before returning
        * Possible bug OCI -> Investigating with Oracle support 

    * Extended OCI_Connection handle attributes

      - Added OCI_IsConnected()
      - Added OCI_SetUserData()
      - Added OCI_GetUserData()

    * Added Support for retrieving server output

      - Added OCI_ServerEnableOutput()
      - Added OCI_ServerDisableOutput()
      - Added OCI_ServerGetOutput()

    * Added Support for OCI Threadkeys
     
      - Thread Keys are kind of process wide variable identified by an string identifier with thread specific values
      - See section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Threads and mutexes>)
      - Added OCI_ThreadKeyCreate()
      - Added OCI_ThreadKeyGetValue()
      - Added OCI_ThreadKeySetValue()

    * Extended runtime loading of Oracle shared libs on various Unix-like systems

      - Added support for Mac OSX (handling 'dylib' lib extension)
      - Added support for some HP/UX platforms (handling 'sl' lib extension)
      - Modified dl_open() flags for AIX and HP/UX

    * Modified OCI_Immediate() and OCI_ImmediateFmt()

      - Extended type safety (public interface modifications) :

        * For output placeholders, you have to pass NOW one of the OCI_ARG_xxx constant to tell OCILIB the type the placeholder pointer
        * Every placeholder pointer has to be preceded by the type constant
        * Example : OCI_Immediate(st, "select int_col, str_col from my_table", OCI_ARG_INT, &my_int, OCI_ARG_TEXT, my_text);
        * Output placeholders : support NOW for short, unsigned short, unsigned int, big_int, big_uint
        * Updated section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Formatted functions>)
  
      - Fixed    : For OCI_ImmediateFmt(), temporary Statement object was not freed (line commented in 2.3.0 with no reasons !)
      - Fixed    : If internal OCI_GetString() returned NULL, a segmentation fault could happen 
      - Modified : No check was done on scalar C type placeholder pointers nullity (possible source of segfault)
      - Modified : OCI_Date handling was not updated with v2.3.0 modifications
      - Modified : OCI_Long and OCI_Statement handling was not removed as stated in the change log of v2.3.0

        * '%hu' : unsigned short
        * '%li' : big_int

      - Fixed : OCI_LobAppendLob() was not updating internal current offset position
      - Fixed : OCI_ParseSqlFmt() : OCI_interval * variable was not checked for nullity
      - Fixed : OCI_Initialize() with runtime loading mode : oracle 11g detection was broken (missing 'else' keyword)
      - Fixed : OCI_GetResultset() : selecting unsupported REF datatype was throwing 2 errors instead of one.
      - Fixed : OCI_GetDate()    + client Oracle 11g + "Return into" clause    : the OCILIB workaround for Oracle bug #3269146 was not working properly
      - Fixed : OCI_BindString() + client Oracle 8i  + OCI_CHARSET_MIXED build : setting internally OCI_ATTR_CHARSET_FORM (since v2.0.0) caused a crash with Oracle 8.1.7.O (OCI bug ?)
      - Normalization of few Function Names :

        * OCI_CreateTransaction() -> OCI_TransactionCreate()
        * OCI_FreeTransaction() -> OCI_TransactionFree()

    * Extended "Formatted" functions support :

      - Added support for OCI_Timestamp (<%p>) and OCI_Interval(<%v>)

    * Public interface (IMPORTANT CHANGES)

      - OCI_Initialize() :

        * New flag : OCI_ENV_THREADED
        * Up to v2.2.0, OCILIB was internally initializing OCI in threaded mode (even for non threaded applications)
        * With  v2.3.0, applications HAVE TO SET EXPLICITLY the flag OCI_ENV_THREADED for multi-threaded applications

      - Normalization of few Function Names :

        * OCI_CreateConnection() -> OCI_ConnectionCreate()
        * OCI_FreeConnection() -> OCI_ConnectionFree()
        * OCI_CreateStatement() -> OCI_StatementCreate()
        * OCI_FreeStatement() -> OCI_StatementFree()

      - Added Macro for existing code compatibility

    * Bug fixes :

      - OCILIB_MINOR_VERSION was not updated
      - A segmentation fault could happen when fetching Long column
      - If an OCI_Statement object or its internal handle could not be allocated, the entry was not removed from the connection statements list
      - Binding and fetching Unicode strings on national character columns: non ANSI characters (code points) were badly converted (Now, it uses national charset form for conversion)
      - OCI_LobErase() : Offset value was wrongly used (shifted by 1) and could cause an error if set to zero
      - OCI_Immediate() and OCI_ImmediateFmt() :

        * Passing OCILIB objects for output result led to crash because of assignment of out-of-scope object pointers
        * Now, pass the OCILIB object handle, NOT the handle address
        * Now, OCI_Long, OCI_Statement are not handled

    * Miscellaneous

      - Added OCI_ReleaseResultsets() : optional call to release resultsets
      - OCI_SetPrefetchSize() and OCI_SetPrefetchMemory() : internal value is now set only is OCI call succeed
      - Internal connection rewrite for handling Connection pool
      - Renamed few function parameters + documentation updates
      - Unicode strings are now converted into database using national charset form
      - OCI environment handle : 

        * Up to v2.2.0, every connection object holded an environment handle
        * Now, there is an unique environment handle associated to the internal OCI_Library object

2008-03-19 Version 2.2.0 Vincent Rogier vince.rogier@gmail.com

    * Public interface

      - Added OCI_SetPrefetchMemory() (see documentation)
      - Added OCI_GetPrefetchMemory()
      - Added OCI_SetPassword()
      - Added OCI_Break()
      - See new section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Aborting long operations>)
      - Modified few functions prototypes with no parameters -> from f() to f(void) for strict ANSI C support 
      - Added 'const' qualifier to nearly all string parameter and string return values

    * Extended OCI_GetString() :

      - Modified : Implicit conversion from double uses now '%f' instead of '%g'.
      - Added support for OCI_Timestamp, OCI_Interval and implicit conversion

    * Fixes

      - Memory leak : If a statement that has returned a resultset is re-executed directly with OCI_Execute() (without any parse step), the previous resultset was not freed
      - Some statements attributes (fetch size, pre-fetched size, bind mode, long mode, long size) where reinitialized at every SQL parsing. Now they are persistent.
      - Constants OCI_FETCH_SIZE, OCI_PREFETCH_SIZE values were set to Oracle default values and were not assigned at statement creation time.
        So, if the library was rebuilt with different values, the modified values where not applied! Now, theses attributes are internally set internally when a statement is created
      - Now server version is initialized when the connection object is created (some tests for some features support could failed)

    * Modifications

      - Added support for OS authentication by passing NULL user and NULL password to OCI_CreateConnection()
      - Modified default date format for implicit conversion (DD/MM/YYYY -> YYYY-MM-DD)
      - Modified OCI_BindXX() calls : if bind mode is OCI_BIND_POS, the position used is now the given bind name (:1, :2, ...) instead of the internal bind object index
      - Modified OCI_CreateConnection() : it returns now NULL id OCI_Initialize() has not been called
      - Reintroduced support for native C++ compilation of OCILIB

    * Miscellaneous

      - Validation of LabWindow/LabView compilers
      - change email -> vince.rogier@gmail.com
      - Modified demo application: tests are now grouped in series of functions
      - Object support in Unicode builds : Oracle confirmed the bug when setting objects attributes (bug #6885036 on Metalink)

2008-03-04 Version 2.1.0 Vincent Rogier vince_rogier@yahoo.fr

    * Added public retrieval of internal OCI handles :

      - See new section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Using OCI Handles directly>)
      - OCI_HandleGetEnvironment()
      - OCI_HandleGetContext()
      - OCI_HandleGetServer()
      - OCI_HandleGetError()
      - OCI_HandleGetSession()
      - OCI_HandleGetTransaction()
      - OCI_HandleGetStatement()

      - See updated section in the documentation (page <module>, section <Internal Large Objects (LOBs)>)
      - Added type lobsize_t (unsigned int or unsigned long long depending platform and compiler)
      - Modified OCI_Lob and OCI_File APIs to change lob size and offset type from unsigned int to lobsize_t 
        
    * Extended Oracle versions support

      - Added OCI_GetVersionConnection()
      - Building OCILIB with versions of Oracle < 10g and OCI_IMPORT_LINKAGE option could fail because :

        * BINARY FLOAT and BINARY DOUBLE (introduced in 10g) type references were not excluded from 8i and 9i builds
        * Some Timestamp and Interval (introduced in 9i) code portions were not excluded from 8i builds

      - Modified Oracle version detection
      - Rewritten conditional code compilation directives for handling correctly all versions of Oracle (8i -> 11g)
      - The library has been through series of tests on the following environments:

          * Servers : 10.2.0.1.0,  8.1.7.0.0           
          * Clients : 11.1.0.6.0, 10.2.0.1.0, 9.2.0.1.0, 9.0.1.0.1

      - few errors were encountered but always linked to Oracle known bugs identified on Metalink : nclobs on 8i, intervals on 9i, Full Unicode handling on 9i
      - Known issues that are currently being investigated: 

        * Oracle 8i only + "mixed charset" build : read/write on a CLOB fetched from a "return into" inserts '\0' between characters (looks like double Unicode expansion..)

    * Modified Error handling

      - Added OCI_ErrorGetType()
      - Removed error messages prefixes "(OCI_xxx) - "
 
    * Fixed :

      - OCI_RegisterDate() caused OCI_Execute() to crash with Oracle < 10g. It is a known Oracle bug (metalink id #3269146 : OCIBindDynamic() with SQL_ODT).
      - OCI_RegisterDate() works nows on version < 10g (using SQLT_ODT for 10g and SQLT_DAT for 8i and 9i)
      - OCI_LobAppendLob() caused an ORA-24805 on Oracle 8.1.x only
      - OCI_xxxxToText() functions now initialize output buffers even on failure
  
2008-02-16 Version 2.0.0 Vincent Rogier vince_rogier@yahoo.fr
 
    * Added Support for Unicode build on Unix-like systems

      - Now, Unicode is correctly handled on Unix systems (4 bytes wchar_t)

      - OCI_RegisterObject()
      - OCI_GetObject()
      - OCI_GetObject2()
      - Known issue : OCI function internally used to set attributes values is causes a crash on Unicode Build
      - So, DO NOT USE OCILIB Object API in Unicode build until i have sorted that with Oracle support

    * Added National attribute (charsetform) support

      - added OCI_GetColumnCharsetForm()
      - added OCI_Lob type OCI_NCLOB

        * Number of bytes for OCI_BLOB and OCI_BLONG
        * Number of characters for OCI_CLOB/OCI_NCLOB and OCI_CLONG

      - OCI_LobGetLength(), OCI_LobGetOffset() and OCI_LongGetSize() return now the length/offset expressed :

        * In bytes for OCI_BLOB and OCI_BLONG
        * In characters for OCI_CLOB/OCI_NCLOB and OCI_CLONG

      - Parameter 'size' of OCI_DateToText(), OCI_TimestampToText(), OCI_TimestampGetTimeZoneName(), OCI_IntervalToText is now :

        * Number of characters

    * Modified OCI_Long objects

      - Added OCI_LongGetBuffer()
      - Modified: Long columns are completely read internally during fetch sequence
      - Modified: OCILIB can handle more than one OCI_Long object in select resultset
      - OCI_LongRead() still supported but obsolete, use instead OCI_LongGetBuffer() 
      - Fixed : insert statement with OCI_Long bind variable that have inserted 0 bytes caused a crash when
        the statement was freed

        AIX "Strict" C Compiler happy !
      - Fixed : Modified configure script for install options on GNU package
      - Fixed : OCI_RegisterString() : the buffer size was wrongly calculated in mixed charset builds
      - Fixed : Corrected spelling of OCI_LobGetLenght() -> OCI_LobGetLength()
      - Fixed : If OCI_RegisterXXX() calls were made in a different order than the variable list in the returning 
        clause, resultset columns were created in the wrong order and leaded to type mismatch

    * Miscellaneous modifications:

      - OCI_Initialize() takes a new parameter for future environment options and extra modes (by default OCI_ENV_DEFAULT)
      - Sometimes, OCI client describes FLOAT as NUMBER... Added extra checks to correct that!

        * UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT the zero terminal terminator.
        * EXPRESSED in CHARACTERS

      - So, for OCI_BindString() :

        * if the string is char    str[31], pass 30 as len instead of 31 in earlier version
        * if the string is wchar_t str[31], pass 30 as len instead of 62 in earlier version

      - So, for OCI_BindArrayOfStrings() :

        * if the string is char    str[10][31], pass 30 as len instead of 31 in earlier version
        * if the string is wchar_t str[10][31], pass 30 as len instead of 62 in earlier version

        indicating the size in character and not in bytes

      - Prototypes for OCI_BindArrayOfInts(), OCI_BindArrayOfDoubles(), OCI_BindArrayOfStrings() changed :

        * For scalar C types (int, double and char*), the 'data' parameter was changed from type** to type* in
          order to avoid compiler warnings and casts
